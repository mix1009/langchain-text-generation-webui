      "Preparations for a new girl group to debut under Big Hit Entertainment[A] began as early as 2019[6] under the direction of Min Hee-jin, who joined the company as CBO that same year and is widely recognized for her art direction as visual director at SM Entertainment.[7] Global auditions took place between September and October 2019, and casting into the group commenced from the beginning of 2020.[6][8] Dubbed \"Min Hee-jin's Girl Group\" by several media outlets,[9][10] the group was originally scheduled to launch in 2021 as a collaborative project between Big Hit and Source Music, but was later postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[6] In late 2021, the project moved to Hybe's newly established independent label ADOR, after Min was appointed the label's CEO.[11] A second round of global auditions were held between December 2021 and January 2022,[12] and the group's line-up was finalized in March 2022.[9][13]\n",
      "Prior to debuting with NewJeans, several group members were already active in the entertainment industry. Danielle was a regular cast member of tvN's Rainbow Kindergarten, a variety show that aired in 2011.[14] Hyein debuted as a member of the children's music group U.SSO Girl in November 2017 under the stage name U.Jeong,[15] before departing from the group one year later.[16] In December 2020, she joined the music group and YouTube collective Play With Me Club formed by PocketTV, and graduated from the group on May 3, 2021.[17] Hanni and Minji made cameo appearances in BTS's 2021 music video for \"Permission to Dance\".[15]\n",

      "On August 1, NewJeans digitally released their debut EP alongside its third single, \"Cookie\".[24] The song was criticized by some reviewers, who thought the lyrics contained a sexual innuendo.[25] ADOR denied the accusation and stated that the lyrics refer to \"the paired idea of burning CDs and baking cookies, which share the same conceptual verb in Korean\".[26] The physical version of the EP was released on August 8 and sold over one million copies, becoming the best selling debut album by a K-pop female act in South Korea and the only debut album to achieve this since Circle Chart's establishment in 2011.[27] New Jeans later won Best K-pop Album at the Korean Music Awards.[28] The group made their broadcast debut on Mnet's M Countdown on August 4, performing all three singles.[29] NewJeans garnered multiple rookie awards at various Korean music award shows, including the Golden Disc Awards,[30] the Seoul Music Awards,[31] the Korean Music Awards,[28] the Melon Music Awards,[32] and the Asia Artist Awards.[33]\n",
      "NewJeans released \"Ditto\" on December 19, 2022, as the first single from their first single album, OMG.[34] \"Ditto\" became the longest-running number one song on South Korea's Circle Digital Chart, topping the chart for thirteen weeks.[35][36] It was NewJeans' first entry on both the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 82,[B] and the UK Singles Chart, charting at number 95.[34] OMG was released on January 2, 2023.[34] Reviewers commended the album for its retro-style theme.[37] It debuted at number one on the Circle Album Chart,[38] selling 700,000 copies in its first week of release.[37] It became their first album to sell over one million copies,[39] shortly before New Jeans also reached one million copies sold.[27] OMG was accompanied by a second single of the same name, which went viral on TikTok.[40] \"OMG\" peaked at number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their highest-ranked song on the chart.[41]\n",
      "In February 2023, the group was invited to perform at the 36th Tokyo Girls Collection festival.[42] In April 2023, NewJeans released \"Zero\" in collaboration with Coca-Cola to promote Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.[43] NewJeans plans to release a new album in July.[44] The group is set to perform at the Lollapalooza and Summer Sonic Festival in August 2023.[45]\n",

      "Artistry[edit]\n",
      "NewJeans's discography is primarily composed of pop and R&B midtempo melodies reminiscent of 1990s music;[46][47] critics have also found hip hop, UK garage, Baltimore club,[48] Jersey club,[49] and moombahton[50] elements in their music. The Guardian's Laura Snapes described their songs as \"sleek and lethally hooky, yet playful and teeming with retro synths and experimental flourishes\".[51] Rhian Daly of NME commented that it is \"hard not to hear elements\" of 90s K-pop girl groups such as S.E.S. and Baby V.O.X in their discography.[50] Music critic Kim Do-heon attributed NewJeans' success in part to their \"carefree, laid-back and natural\" sound,[52] while Tamar Herman wrote in Vogue that their music \"immediately changed up the face of South Korea's pop idol scene\".[46]\n",
      "NewJeans' music is mainly produced by South Korean singers 250 and Park Jin-su (also known as FRNK), while the members often participate in songwriting.[51] As the executive producer, Min Hee-jin selects all NewJeans' songs and is responsible for the recording process.[53] Regarding the group's debut EP, Min said she \"wanted to break the tacit formula of K-pop and make an album with the music I want\".[54] Min disliked \"high-pitched parts, awkward raps that suddenly appear, and singing methods that feel uniform\" and chose to record without guide vocals, allowing the members to develop their own singing styles.[53][47]\"\n",

      "In collaboration with both Musinsa and LG Electronics, the group released a limited edition of the Gram laptop with gadgets inspired by NewJeans' concept.[74] Outfits matching the laptop were available to customers who had made a reservation for LG Electronics' pop-up store which opened in Seongsu-dong in January 2023 to promote the product.[75] The group collaborated with McDonald's to launch two new chicken burger menus featuring NewJeans-themed gadgets in South Korea in March 2023.[76][77]\n",

The Guardian's Laura Snapes described their songs as \"sleek and lethally hooky, yet playful and teeming with retro synths and experimental flourishes\".[51] Rhian Daly of NME commented that it is \"hard not to hear elements\" of 90s K-pop girl groups such as S.E.S. and Baby V.O.X in their discography.[50] Music critic Kim Do-heon attributed NewJeans' success in part to their \"carefree, laid-back and natural\" sound,[52] while Tamar Herman wrote in Vogue that their music \"immediately changed up the face of South Korea's pop idol scene\".[46]\n",
       "NewJeans' music is mainly produced by South Korean singers 250 and Park Jin-su (also known as FRNK), while the members often participate in songwriting.[51] As the executive producer, Min Hee-jin selects all NewJeans' songs and is responsible for the recording process.[53] Regarding the group's debut EP, Min said she \"wanted to break the tacit formula of K-pop and make an album with the music I want\".[54] Min disliked \"high-pitched parts, awkward raps that suddenly appear, and singing methods that feel uniform\" and chose to record without guide vocals, allowing the members to develop their own singing styles.[53][47]\"\n",

Despite backlash, the group's physical album sold over one million copies upon its release on August 8 and won Best K-pop Album at the Korean Music Awards. They continued to receive numerous rookie awards at different music ceremonies throughout the year, including the Golden Disk Award, Seoul Music Award, and Melon Music Award. In February 2023, they were invited to perform at the Tokyo Girls Collection festival. In April, they collaborated with Coca-Cola to promote Coca-Cola Zero Sugar with their fourth single, \"Zero\". Plans are underway for a new album release in July. Critics have praised NewJeans for their retro-style themes, sleek and laid-back sound, and unique vocal performances.\n",

They continued to receive numerous rookie awards at different music ceremonies throughout the year, including the Golden Disk Award, Seoul Music Award, and Melon Music Award. In February 2023, they were invited to perform at the Tokyo Girls Collection festival. In April, they collaborated with Coca-Cola to promote Coca-Cola Zero Sugar with their fourth single, \"Zero\". Plans are underway for a new album release in July. Critics have praised NewJeans for their retro-style themes, sleek and laid-back sound, and unique vocal performances.\n",
